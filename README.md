Extreme events stress New York City’s (NYC’s) interdependent energy and water infrastructures; impact human livelihood; and can disrupt local ecosystems. The dependence of water and wastewater operations on electricity implies that a blackout, coupled with backup system components’ failures, can force the discharge of untreated wastewater into NYC’s waterways, and result in a public health emergency. Data-driven and optimization techniques can leverage publicly available data to reveal vulnerabilities in electricity and water/wastewater infrastructures. Our analysis can aid policy design against natural hazards and cyberattacks, and thus inform the modernization of interdependent urban electricity and water/wastewater infrastructures.

This project aims to identify supply chain vulnerabilities of New York City’s physical water and wastewater infrastructure; and inform resilience policies against natural disasters. The project will:
●	Provide a water and wastewater management framework which integrates publicly available databases.
●	Perform a scenario for each water and wastewater infrastructures using different machine learning methods.
●	Visualize the results to clearly display the impact from the vulnerabilities.
●	Pose possible future implications or recommendations.

Please read our technical project report for more details. Details about individual infrastructure databases have been added in respective folders.
